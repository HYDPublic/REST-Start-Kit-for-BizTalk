**Project Description**
This project enables BizTalk Server to expose RESTFul services through the WCF-Custom adapter.

The library supports both receive and send, both XML and JSON with all HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT and DELETE).

The solution is based on two custom WCF behaviors, one to be used on Receive Locations and one on Send Ports. Hopeully you'll find them easy to use, but if you have any issues, please use the discussions forum.
